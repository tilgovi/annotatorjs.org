Using Jekyll for the Annotator "News" Section
* Ensure that the jekyll gem is installed on your machine
* The jekyll source dir is _news/, and destination dir is news/.
* To add a post, cd into _news/, and run 'rake post title="Your Title Here"'. This will create a file in _posts. Edit the content of the post in that file to your heart's desire.
* After you've edited your post, run "jekyll build" from the _news/ directory, which will compile into news/. Note that _news/ is checked into the repository, but news/ is gitignored. Upon deploy, "jekyll build" needs to to be run to compile into news/ on the live site. 
* The CSS paths in _news/head.html are set as absolute paths to ensure they will include the base directory CSS files. This may cause problems in your development instance if you are not running on the localhost path.

*** Attention ***
"jekyll build" must be run to compile the source to the destination on the live site.
